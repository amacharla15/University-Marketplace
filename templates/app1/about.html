    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      University Marketplace is a full-stack web application built to provide university
      students with a dedicated platform to buy, sell, or exchange goods and services within
      their academic community. Inspired by students using social media stories to sell textbooks,
      electronics, furniture, or sublease apartments, this platform aims to centralize and streamline
      that informal process into a secure and organized online marketplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students must register and log in using official university email addresses to ensure that
      only verified users can participate. Once authenticated, users can manage their profiles
      and item listings. Each listing includes images, descriptions, prices, and tags for easier
      discovery by others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The homepage displays an updated feed of all items, with a search bar and category filters
      to help users find what they need. Users can also favorite listings, contact sellers via
      in-app chat, and schedule appointments to meet on campus for item inspection and pickup.
      After each transaction, users may leave ratings and reviews to build trust in the community
      and improve accountability.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Django, and PostgreSQL.
      It’s containerized with Docker and deployed to Google Cloud Platform behind a load balancer
      with at least two app servers. User-uploaded images are stored using GCP Buckets. The
      <code>/server_info/</code> path shows configuration and server environment details for
      debugging purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Advanced features include a wishlist, real-time notifications, a basic item recommender
      system, and optional dark mode. These additions improve user experience, encourage
      engagement, and differentiate the platform from basic listing boards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The responsive design ensures accessibility across both mobile and desktop devices.
      University Marketplace empowers students to engage in secure, efficient, and community-
      driven exchanges while solving a real problem faced by students in everyday campus life.
